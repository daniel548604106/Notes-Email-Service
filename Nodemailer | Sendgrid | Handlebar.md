## FAQ

#### What is handlebar and how is it useful?

Handlebars is one of the most used templating engines for web applications “competing” with other well-known ones like Mustache js, Pug, EJS and others. It’s especially used on the server side along with the express js framework.

#### Why are we using sendgrid?

Twilio SendGrid offers a Web API that allows customers to retrieve information about their accounts such as statistics, bounces, spam reports, unsubscribes, and more. 

- Deliverability: SendGrid maintains an excellent reputation with common email clients, leading to higher deliverability rates, and less chance of being caught in spam filters.
- Throughput: SendGrid handles large email volume with ease. SendGrid’s simple plans let you send “around 12,000 emails per month” for free.
- Analytics: You can act like a tech-mogul, shouting out figures like your “click-through rates” and “A/B Test Results” using SendGrids’s beautiful dashboard.
- Transactions & Marketing: Manage all your email communications via one platform. No more tab-switching.
